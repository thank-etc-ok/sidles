# Sidles
Minimal presentation solution, suited for rapidly writing many slides using the [Takahashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takahashi_method)/[Lessig](http://presentationzen.blogs.com/presentationzen/2005/10/the_lessig_meth.html) method.

![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thank-etc-ok/sidles/master/example.gif)

One slide per line in `slides.txt`, slides can use HTML elements.

Left and right arrows or mouse control navigation.

Has to be run from a server (`npm install -g http-server`) and most likely to run in a browser that supports `fetch` (Chrome).

All code is contained in `index.html`.
