# Sidles
Minimal presentation solution, suited for rapidly writing many slides.

![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thank-etc-ok/sidles/master/example.gif)

One slide per line in `slides.txt`, slides can use HTML elements.

Left and right arrows control navigation.

Has to be run from a server (npm install -g http-server) and most likely to run in a browser that supports `fetch` (Chrome).

All code is contained in `index.html`.
