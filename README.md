# Sidles
Super minimal presentation solution, suited for rapidly writing many slides.

One slide per line in `slides.txt`, slides can use HTML elements.

Left and right arrows control navigation.

Has to be run from a server and most likely to run in a browser that supports `fetch`.

All code is contained in `index.html`.
